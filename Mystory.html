<p style="display:block; width: 860px;"> 	Rows of crystal jars line my bedroom shelves, housing my childhood collections: silly bands, ChapSticks, Webkinz, erasers, eraser dust. The progression from erasers to eraser shavings served a revelatory function, awakening me to the futility of these purposeless collections, nudging me toward a new hobby – one with a meaningful purpose: fashionable deconstruction. My moment of realization occurred while unpacking from my family's move from Jericho, New York to Miami, Florida.

Six years prior, my mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt confused, uneducated about the disease, and scared. My mother, however, was the bravest I’ve ever seen her. To celebrate her strength and recovery, my sister and I had organized a team to participate in the Making Strides for Breast Cancer Walk in NY.  Our effort raised over $50,000 to help other families, and my family’s personal battles with this disease sparked a lifelong commitment not only to helping to find a cure, but to empowering all women in new and creative ways.

During her fight against breast cancer, my mom had cut out the pink ribbon symbol from a t-shirt commemorating the fundraiser. Standing in our new living room, my mother lifted the cotton square from her suitcase and looked at me with a confluence of emotions, her fingers gripping the patch, unwilling to toss the memory aside. The fateful decision to sew the patch onto the flannel shirt I wore while unpacking our moving boxes, marked the formation of SoJara, a fashion collaboration between my mother and I, named in her honor.

I had never imagined myself as artistic in any way, until classmates fawned over the appliqués with which I adorned my wardrobe, my everyday outfit selections becoming some of the first “marketing” for our new clothing brand. With my mother at the helm, SoJara soon grew into a popular niche market with women of all ages, and I learned a great deal about business practices from her while I experimented with new designs that would appeal to teens. My mom and I spent afternoons together scouring the city for flannels and t-shirts to decorate. Finding that themes such as classic rock bands, peace signs, and messages of positivity especially appealed to the teen customers I interacted with, I visited thrift stores and garage sales for vintage and one-of-a-kind adornments that now fill new jars in my bedroom.

After the uncertainty of life with a cancer diagnosis, I was just grateful to spend time with my mom; however, as the company grew, so did my role within it. The persistence that had driven my childhood collections now helped to fuel a real family business! While continuing to contribute my designs to our growing inventory, I also took charge of SoJara’s social media. While friends, classmates, and neighbors discovered our designs by word-of-mouth, creating a presence for SoJara on social media has allowed me to connect with customers in 30 different locations. It has been a thrill to help this family business to grow from a single shirt into a thriving company, and fascinating to experience that growth from so many different perspectives, from learning the basics of social media advertising, to helping create and staff pop up stores during Miami events such as Art Basel, and my favorite of all: seeing my designs put a smile on a customer’s face.

My secret is that the clothes I design are not really about fashion. I am inspired by 60’s revolutionaries and 90’s riot grrls, Guerrilla art and the fight for equality that remains as relevant today as it did for previous generations. And, my mom. I watched her beat cancer, demonstrating that anything is possible. Every shirt I design is really my voice, passionately communicating words of hope and strength - positive messages to wear across our bodies like armor. Today, I reach into the endless jars of my collection and share my vision with the world.
